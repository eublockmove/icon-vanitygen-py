# icon-vanitygen-py
ICON Vanity Address Generator for Python

## Installation

This script requires iconsdk to run:
```
pip install iconsdk
```

Download the script:
```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eublockmove/icon-vanitygen-py/master/vanitygen.py
```

## Use

To look for a vanity address, simply run the script with input variable:

```
python vanitygen.py 123abc
```

## Notes

Since ICON addresses are Hexes, only numbers 0-9 and letters a-f can be used. This process is CPU intensive and can run in reasonable time for up to 6 characters.
